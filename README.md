# New Rules and Syntax  
including square root, parentsis and a logaryhmic functions changes alot in how numbers  
are allowed to appear on the output displays. they bring in new Bugs and Concepts.  
thats why new Rules have been addet that the user dosent need to know but the calculator  
wont allow the use to break these rules.  

2# example:  

the use can't just write 2sqr(""). the Calculator wont respond.  

parenthesis can be placed how the user indends to but if the brakets are not closed   

the calculator will ignore the not closed brakets.  
brakets in log are pre set and cant be deleted by the "Delete" button
